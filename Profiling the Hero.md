> This is a great insight to be honest. Rizal only wanted equal grounds for both Filipinos and Spaniards. To provide them with humanity as equal as the others. Viewing the entire country not only as a separate state from the "others" but also on a global scale, that they have just as equal grounds to pursue freedom and their passions as other people do. I've always had this negative connotation about the notion that Rizal did not want the Philippines to be completely severed from its Western colonizers. He valued the resources and knowledge that is being shared by other countries to flourish and as such, wanted to incorporate the same grounds of growth for Filipinos. Not as separates from these other nations, but rather be part of this global community. He not only eyed independence, but rather a point of globalization for Filipinos to flourish back home and overseas.
